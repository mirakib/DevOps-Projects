This repository serves as a versatile software development portfolio, showcasing a variety of projects built across multiple, competing full-stack ecosystems. The core focus is on demonstrating proficiency and adaptability by implementing identical application. A study in cross-stack development, architectural comparison, and technology mastery.

## What is a "stack"?

A stack is a set (or “stack”) of technologies that work together to build and run applications — typically including:

1. Operating System (O)
2. Web Server (W)
3. Database (D)
4. Programming Language / Framework (P)

## The Classic Stacks

1. **LAMP**	- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
2. **LEMP**	- Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP/Python/Perl
3. **MEAN**	- MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js
4. **MERN**	- MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
5. **MEVN**	- MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js
