This project provides a beginner-friendly walkthrough for installing and configuring n8n on a self-hosted Ubuntu server using Docker Compose. You’ll also learn how to resolve common setup errors, secure your instance with HTTPS, and avoid pitfalls during production deployment.


# Key Takeaways:

Self-hosting is recommended for developers and small teams seeking full control, data privacy, and the ability to customize every aspect of their workflow automation. By running n8n on your own infrastructure, you avoid vendor lock-in and can tailor the environment to your specific needs.
Docker Compose on Ubuntu offers a robust, production-ready way to deploy n8n. Using Docker Compose simplifies the management of multiple services (like the n8n app, PostgreSQL database, and reverse proxy), enables easy upgrades, and provides built-in restart policies for reliability and scalability.
Initial setup includes setup of a PostgreSQL database for persistent workflow and credential storage, configuring Docker containers for n8n and supporting services, setting up HTTPS with Nginx and Let’s Encrypt for secure web access, and creating an owner account to manage your instance. This ensures your automation platform is secure, stable, and ready for production use.
Secure your instance by enabling HTTPS to encrypt all traffic, setting strong credentials, and configuring environment variables to avoid insecure cookies and open ports. For production deployments, it’s critical to restrict access, use firewalls, and regularly update your containers to patch vulnerabilities.
Free license activation unlocks premium features such as advanced workflow triggers, additional integrations, and priority support for community users. Activating your free license is a simple process and provides access to features that enhance automation capabilities without incurring extra costs.
Visual workflows can be built using n8n’s intuitive drag-and-drop editor. You can easily add triggers (like webhooks or scheduled events), set up conditional logic, execute shell commands, and connect to hundreds of third-party services (such as Slack, GitHub, or Google Sheets) without writing code.
Example use case: Imagine monitoring your server’s uptime with UptimeRobot. If downtime is detected, n8n can automatically run a shell command to attempt recovery, then send real-time notifications to your team via Slack, WhatsApp, or Discord. This reduces manual intervention and speeds up incident response.
Extensible design means you can integrate n8n with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), ticketing systems (Jira, Zendesk), and even agentic AI frameworks for intelligent automation. The modular architecture allows you to add custom nodes, connect to any API, and build complex, multi-step workflows that scale with your organization’s needs.
