#  Kubernetes Learning Projects

This repository contains my hands-on Kubernetes learning projects and practice exercises.  
It serves as a personal playground where I build, break, and rebuild various components of modern cloud-native infrastructure.

The goal of this repo is to understand Kubernetes from the ground up — starting with basic concepts and gradually moving toward more production-grade setups, automation, and DevOps best practices.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Track my Kubernetes learning progress  
- Build reusable templates for future DevOps/SRE work  
- Practice real-world troubleshooting scenarios  
- Prepare for Kubernetes certification & job interviews  

## Tools & Technologies

- Kubernetes
- Docker / Containerd
- Minikube, Kind, or K3s
- Kubectl
- Helm (optional in advanced sections)
- Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
- GitHub Actions (optional for CI/CD)

## Practice playgrounds

 If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using **minikube** or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:
